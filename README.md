## What is this?

If you are starting a new site today, you should **not** use this repository.

## Migration (to the modern Tailwind-based HugoBlox)

> [!TIP]
> The Tailwind successor to Wowchemy Bootstrap is built on **HugoBlox Kit**.  
> Start by deploying the Tailwind equivalent of your template, then migrate your content.

### 1) Deploy the Tailwind equivalent template

Choose one of the following:

**Option A — Online (1-click)**
- Deploy from the template gallery: https://hugoblox.com/templates/

**Option B — CLI**
```bash
npm install -g hugoblox@latest
hugoblox create site
```

### 2) Install HugoBlox Studio (VS Code)

> [!NOTE]
> HugoBlox Studio lets you visually configure pages, sections, and site settings without hand-editing lots of YAML/Markdown.

- Install the extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hugoblox.hugoblox-studio

### 3) Migrate your content incrementally

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Migrate gradually to reduce risk: get the new site deployed first, then port content in small batches.

- Copy your pages and posts from `content/`
- Copy media assets from `assets/media/`

Then:
- Build locally and verify key pages
- Check menus, taxonomies, and front matter
- Validate any custom shortcodes/partials (some may need updating)

### 4) Publish

Once your migrated pages look correct, push to your repo and redeploy (Netlify / GitHub Pages / your host of choice).
